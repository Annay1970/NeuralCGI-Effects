- Click "**Commit new file**".

## **Step 4: Recommended Initial Project Structure**
Create the directories and folders by clicking "**Add file → Create new file**" on GitHub and typing folder names as follows:

- `src/` (Main source code)
- `docs/` (Documentation and guides)
- `scripts/` (Utility scripts)
- `examples/` (Demonstrations and usage examples)
- `models/` (AI and neural models)
- `tests/` (Automated testing scripts)

> **Note:** On GitHub, to create folders you simply type the folder name followed by a `/` and then a placeholder file like `.gitkeep` or `README.md`.

Example:  
src/.gitkeep docs/.gitkeep scripts/.gitkeep examples/.gitkeep models/.gitkeep tests/.gitkeep

## **Step 5: Optional—Set up Continuous Integration (CI)**

- Go to your repository → **Actions** tab.
- Choose a pre-defined workflow such as "**Python application**".
- Follow GitHub’s guide to automatically run tests when changes are made.

---

### **What to do next after setup:**
- Clone the repository to your PC to begin coding.
- Use AI tools (like me) to help you develop initial software functionalities, debug errors, and guide development.
- Commit and push changes regularly.
